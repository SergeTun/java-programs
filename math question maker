  Task:
    Write a program that randomly generates two numbers
    from a chosen range (e.g. 10-99). Then display a math
    question involving those two numbers to the user
    (e.g. "62 - 17 = ?"). Then ask the user for their response
    and print a computer response based on if they were
    correct or incorrect.

    What is 62 - 17?
    >> 10
    Wrong, the correct answer was 45

    What is 62 - 17?
    >> 45
    Correct!
